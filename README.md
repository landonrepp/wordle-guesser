# Wordle Guesser

Wordle Guesser is an automated tool that plays the online game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) from the browser.

This project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev), an open-source browser automation tool from Microsoft, to open a browser and play the game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). It uses a custom algorithm to deductively find the correct word of the day.
